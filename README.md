BBUI-Plugin
===========

Plugin to make the context menu work with BBui.js

Made to be the WebWorks 2.0 version of this plugin: https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js/tree/master/pkg/bb10.  To make the context menu work with BBui.js and WebWorks 2.0:

1. Add copy the com.blackberry.bbui directory to your /BB10 WebWorks SDK <version>/plugin/ directory
2. Add the plugin to your WebWorks 2.0 project using "webworks plugin add com.blackberry.bbui".

It is now functional, tested on the Dev Alpha C running 10.2.  I may have plugged in some pretty random code, so if someone who actually knows what they're doing with Cordova plugins would look at this, it would be much appreciated!  Thanks.
